To use this in your own project:

- Use .NET 3.5 or later.  (It could become 2.0 compatible with very minimal changes, an exercise for the reader.)
- Change the connection string name in the DynamicDataAccess class.
- Apply the ColumnInTable attribute to your Data Object properties, or pass a mapping function matching the DataMapper delegate.
