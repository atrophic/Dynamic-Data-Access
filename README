To use this in your own project:

- Use .NET 3.5 or later.  (It could become 2.0 compatible with very minimal changes, an exercise for the reader.)
- Change the connection string name in the DynamicDataAccess class.
- Do one of the following three things.
	- Ensure your Data Object propeties match the names of the columns in the table.
	- Apply the ColumnInTable attribute to your Data Object properties that do not match
	- Pass as a parameter a mapping function matching the DataMapper delegate found in DynamicDataAccess.
